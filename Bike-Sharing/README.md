# Project 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
In this project, we will implement a neural network from scratch, to predict daily bike rental riderships based on variables such as season, windspeed, 
temperature, etc. The data that we'll be using comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). First, we'll load and preprocess this data, before building and training the neural 
network, and finally using it to predict bike rentals in our test data.

### Project Structure
This repository has the following structure

    .
    ├── Bike-Sharing-Dataset                # Bike Rentals Dataset             
    │  ├── days.csv
    │  ├── hours.csv
    │  ├── Readme.txt
    ├── assets                              # Images
    ├── Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
    ├── my_answers.py                                    
    ├── requirements.txt                    # Code Requirements 
    └── README.md

The codes to build, train, run, as well as to perforrm backward and forward propagation are implemented in the my_answers.py file, whereas the 
Your_first_neural_network.ipynb file contains codes for loading and preprocessing the dataset, calling and training the neural network built in my_answers.py, and using it to predict bike rentals.
