# Project 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
In this project, we will implement a neural network from scratch, to predict daily bike rental riderships based on variables such as season, windspeed, 
temperature, etc. The data that we'll be using comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). First, we'll load and preprocess this data, before building and training the neural 
network, and finally using it to predict bike rentals in our test data.
