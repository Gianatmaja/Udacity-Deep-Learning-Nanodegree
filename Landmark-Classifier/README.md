# Project 2: Landmark Classification & Tagging
In this project, we will implement a landmark classifier to predict the possible location of the image based on the landmarks depicted in it. To do this, we will build and train a CNN model, experimenting with its weights and layers, as well as trying out a pretained network. Then, after evaluation, we will try out the network on various images to see if it can successfully identify the location of the images based on the landmarks present. The dataset used in this project can be obtained [here](https://udacity-dlnfd.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/datasets/landmark_images.zip).

### Project Structure
This repository has the following structure

    .
    ├── images                                         
    ├── landmark.ipynb
    ├── model_scratch.pt                             
    ├── ignore.pt               
    └── README.md

All of the codes are implemented in the landmark.ipynb file, from loading and preprocessing the dataset, to builing and training the neural networks, as well as predicting with test images. The files model_scratch.pt and ignore.pt are 2 examples of the models tested, whereas the images folder contains the test images.

### Results
Some screenshots of the results obtained during the project can be seen below.
