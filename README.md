This repository contains the projects I completed for the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

### Project 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns

In this project, we will implement a neural network from scratch, to predict daily bike rental riderships based on variables such as season, windspeed, 
temperature, etc. The data that we'll be using comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). First, we'll load and preprocess this data, before building and training the neural 
network, and finally using it to predict bike rentals in our test data.

### Project 2: Landmark Classification & Tagging

In this project, we will implement a landmark classifier to predict the possible location of the image based on the landmarks depicted in it. To do this, we will build and train a CNN model, experimenting with its weights and layers, as well as trying out a pretained network. Then, after evaluation, we will try out the network on various images to see if it can successfully identify the location of the images based on the landmarks present.
