# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree
This repository contains the projects I completed for the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

### Project 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns

In this project, we will implement a neural network from scratch, to predict daily bike rental riderships based on variables such as season, windspeed, 
temperature, etc. The data that we'll be using comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). First, we'll load and preprocess this data, before building and training the neural 
network, and finally using it to predict bike rentals in our test data.

### Project 2: Landmark Classification & Tagging

In this project, we will implement a landmark classifier to predict the possible location of the image based on the landmarks depicted in it. To do this, we will build and train a CNN model, experimenting with its weights and layers, as well as trying out a pretained network. Then, after evaluation, we will try out the network on various images to see if it can successfully identify the location of the images based on the landmarks present. The dataset used in this project can be obtained [here](https://udacity-dlnfd.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/datasets/landmark_images.zip).

### Project 3: Generate TV Scripts

In this project, we will be generating TV scripts using an RNN model. To do this, we'll be using a TV script dataset from 9 seasons of Seinfeld. We'll be loading and preprocessing this data, before using it to train the RNN that we defined. In the end, we'll be using the trained network to generate fake TV scripts.

### Project 4: Generate Faces

In this project, we will be using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) to generate faces. We will be defining and training adversarial networks on the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html). Then, we'll see how it performs by using is to generate fake sample faces.

### Project 5: Deploying a sentiment Analysis Model

In this project, we will be training a neural network to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews. Then, we'll deploy the trained model on an AWS instance. We'll also use AWS Lambda and API Gateway so that the model is accessible from a web app. For this project, we'll be using the [IMDB Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
